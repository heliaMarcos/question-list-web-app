# Bliss Recruitment App â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project was done as a test for the Bliss recruitment process.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:question-list-web-app.git
cd question-web-app
```

You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Install Dependencies

There are two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.

* We get the tools via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

The `npm` will automatically run `bower` so you can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

Start the server:

```
npm start
```

Browse to the app: `http://localhost:8080/`.
